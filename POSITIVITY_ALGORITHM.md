# Positivity Score Algorithm: Technical Documentation

## Overview

The Positivity Score Algorithm is the core innovation of the Vedic Astrology Prediction Engine. It translates complex astrological calculations into a single numerical value ranging from -1 (highly challenging) to +1 (highly favorable), representing the cosmic favorability for any given date.

## Algorithm Components

### 1. Planetary Weights

Each planet is assigned a weight based on its traditional Vedic classification:

```javascript
planetWeights = {
  SUN: 0.3,      // Neutral to slightly positive (Surya)
  MOON: 0.8,     // Highly benefic (Chandra)
  MERCURY: 0.6,  // Benefic (Budh)
  VENUS: 0.9,    // Highly benefic (Shukra)
  MARS: -0.4,    // Malefic (Mangal)
  JUPITER: 0.9,  // Highly benefic (Guru)
  SATURN: -0.6,  // Malefic (Shani)
  URANUS: 0.2,   // Slightly positive (modern planet)
  NEPTUNE: 0.4,  // Benefic (modern planet)
  PLUTO: -0.2    // Slightly negative (modern planet)
}
```

**Vedic Astrological Basis:**
- **Jupiter (Guru)**: The most benefic planet, representing wisdom, knowledge, and spiritual growth
- **Venus (Shukra)**: Highly benefic, governing love, beauty, and material comforts
- **Moon (Chandra)**: Benefic, representing mind, emotions, and intuition
- **Mercury (Budh)**: Benefic, governing communication, intelligence, and business
- **Sun (Surya)**: Neutral to slightly positive, representing soul, authority, and father
- **Mars (Mangal)**: Malefic, representing energy, courage, but also conflicts and accidents
- **Saturn (Shani)**: Malefic, representing discipline, delays, and challenges

### 2. House Weights

Each house is weighted based on its traditional significance:

```javascript
houseWeights = {
  1: 0.8,   // Ascendant - highly positive (Lagna)
  2: 0.4,   // Wealth - positive (Dhana)
  3: 0.3,   // Communication - slightly positive (Sahaja)
  4: 0.7,   // Home - positive (Sukha)
  5: 0.9,   // Creativity/Children - highly positive (Putra)
  6: -0.3,  // Health/Enemies - slightly negative (Ari)
  7: 0.6,   // Partnership - positive (Kalatra)
  8: -0.5,  // Transformation - negative (Mrityu)
  9: 0.9,   // Fortune - highly positive (Bhagya)
  10: 0.8,  // Career - highly positive (Karma)
  11: 0.7,  // Gains - positive (Labha)
  12: -0.4  // Losses - negative (Vyaya)
}
```

**Vedic Astrological Basis:**
- **1st House (Lagna)**: Represents self, personality, and life force
- **5th House (Putra)**: Creativity, children, education, and intelligence
- **9th House (Bhagya)**: Fortune, spirituality, and higher learning
- **10th House (Karma)**: Career, profession, and social status
- **4th House (Sukha)**: Home, mother, and emotional security
- **7th House (Kalatra)**: Partnership, marriage, and relationships
- **11th House (Labha)**: Gains, income, and fulfillment of desires
- **2nd House (Dhana)**: Wealth, family, and speech
- **3rd House (Sahaja)**: Communication, siblings, and courage
- **6th House (Ari)**: Health, enemies, and obstacles
- **8th House (Mrityu)**: Transformation, mysteries, and challenges
- **12th House (Vyaya)**: Losses, expenses, and spiritual liberation

### 3. Dasha Influence

The current dasha period adds 50% additional weight to the calculation:

```javascript
// Add Dasha influence
const dashaWeight = this.planetWeights[dasha] || 0;
totalScore += dashaWeight * 0.5; // Dasha has 50% additional weight
```

**Vedic Astrological Basis:**
- **Vimshottari Dasha**: The most important timing system in Vedic astrology
- **Dasha Periods**: Each planet rules for a specific number of years
- **Current Dasha**: The ruling planet's influence is amplified during its period

### 4. Aspect Analysis

Planetary aspects are calculated and weighted:

```javascript
getAspectType(angle) {
  const tolerance = 8; // 8 degrees tolerance
  
  if (Math.abs(angle - 0) <= tolerance) return { type: 'conjunction', influence: -0.3 };
  if (Math.abs(angle - 60) <= tolerance) return { type: 'sextile', influence: 0.4 };
  if (Math.abs(angle - 90) <= tolerance) return { type: 'square', influence: -0.5 };
  if (Math.abs(angle - 120) <= tolerance) return { type: 'trine', influence: 0.6 };
  if (Math.abs(angle - 180) <= tolerance) return { type: 'opposition', influence: -0.4 };
  
  return null;
}
```

**Vedic Astrological Basis:**
- **Trine (120°)**: Most harmonious aspect, represents natural flow and ease
- **Sextile (60°)**: Harmonious aspect, represents opportunities and cooperation
- **Conjunction (0°)**: Neutral to challenging, depends on planet combinations
- **Square (90°)**: Challenging aspect, represents conflicts and obstacles
- **Opposition (180°)**: Challenging aspect, represents tension and polarization

## Mathematical Formula

The complete algorithm combines all components:

```javascript
calculatePositivityScore(birthDate, targetDate, latitude, longitude) {
  const planetaryPositions = this.calculatePlanetaryPositions(targetDate, latitude, longitude);
  const dasha = this.calculateDasha(birthDate, targetDate);
  
  let totalScore = 0;
  let planetCount = 0;
  
  // Calculate planetary influence
  Object.keys(planetaryPositions).forEach(planet => {
    if (this.planetWeights[planet]) {
      const position = planetaryPositions[planet];
      const planetWeight = this.planetWeights[planet];
      const houseWeight = this.houseWeights[position.house] || 0;
      
      // Combined influence of planet and house
      const influence = (planetWeight + houseWeight) / 2;
      totalScore += influence;
      planetCount++;
    }
  });
  
  // Add Dasha influence
  const dashaWeight = this.planetWeights[dasha] || 0;
  totalScore += dashaWeight * 0.5; // Dasha has 50% additional weight
  
  // Normalize score to range -1 to 1
  const normalizedScore = totalScore / (planetCount + 0.5);
  
  return Math.max(-1, Math.min(1, normalizedScore));
}
```

**Formula Breakdown:**
1. **Planetary Influence**: `(Planet Weight + House Weight) / 2`
2. **Dasha Amplification**: `Dasha Weight * 0.5`
3. **Normalization**: `Total Score / (Planet Count + 0.5)`
4. **Range Clamping**: `max(-1, min(1, score))`

## Score Interpretation

The algorithm produces scores that can be interpreted as follows:

| Score Range | Level | Description | Vedic Interpretation |
|-------------|-------|-------------|---------------------|
| 0.7 - 1.0 | Excellent | Highly favorable period | Guru-Mangal yoga, strong benefic influences |
| 0.4 - 0.7 | Good | Generally supportive | Benefic planets in auspicious houses |
| 0.1 - 0.4 | Moderate | Mixed influences | Balanced planetary positions |
| -0.2 - 0.1 | Challenging | Growth opportunities | Saturn/Mars influences, learning periods |
| -1.0 - -0.2 | Difficult | Requires patience | Malefic combinations, karmic lessons |

## Correlation with Vedic Principles

### 1. Karma and Dharma
- **High Scores**: Indicate periods where dharma (righteous action) is supported
- **Low Scores**: Represent karmic lessons and growth opportunities

### 2. Planetary Combinations (Yogas)
- **Guru-Mangal Yoga**: Jupiter-Mars combination often produces high scores
- **Shani-Surya Yoga**: Saturn-Sun combination typically produces lower scores
